# CoreOS Vagrant

This repo provides a template Vagrantfile to create a CoreOS virtual machine using the Virtualbox software hypervisor.
After setup is complete you will have a single CoreOS virtual machine running on your local machine.

## Streamlined setup

1) Install dependencies

* [Virtualbox][virtualbox] 4.0 or greater.
* [Vagrant][vagrant] 1.3.1 or greater.

2) Clone this project and get it running!

```
git clone https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant/
cd coreos-vagrant
```

3) Startup and SSH

There are two "providers" for Virtualbox with slightly different instructions.
Follow one of the folowing two options:

**Virtualbox Provider**

The Virtualbox provider is the default Vagrant provider. Use this if you are unsure.

```
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```

**VMWare Provider**

The VMWare provider is a commercial addon from Hashicorp that offers better stability and speed.
If you use this provider follow these instructions.

```
vagrant up --provider vmware_fusion
vagrant ssh
```

``vagrant up`` triggers vagrant to download the CoreOS image (if necessary) and (re)launch the instance

``vagrant ssh`` connects you to the virtual machine.
Configuration is stored in the directory so you can always return to this machine by executing vagrant ssh from the directory where the Vagrantfile was located.

3) Get started [using CoreOS][using-coreos]

[vagrant]: http://downloads.vagrantup.com/

#### Shared Folder Setup

There is optional shared folder setup.
You can try it out by adding a section to your Vagrantfile like this.

```
config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "172.12.8.150"
config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/home/core/share", id: "core", :nfs => true,  :mount_options   => ['nolock,vers=3,udp']
```

After a 'vagrant reload' you will be prompted for your password for your local machine.

## New Box Versions

CoreOS is a rolling release distribution and versions that are out of date will automatically update.
If you want to start from the most up to date version you will need to make sure that you have the latest box file of CoreOS.
Simply remove the old box file and vagrant will download the latest one the next time you `vagrant up`.

```
vagrant box remove coreos vmware_fusion
vagrant box remove coreos virtualbox
```

## Cluster Setup

This will setup a 3 node cluster with networking setup between the nodes.
This feature is very new and etcd bootstrapping will be added soon.

```
git clone https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant/
cd coreos-vagrant/cluster
vagrant up
vagrant ssh core-01
vagrant ssh core-02
vagrant ssh core-03
```

## Alternative Setup

This allows you to run multiple instances without needing to clone the repo each time. It will create a 
Vagrantfile in your current directory and so, you will be able to (re)connect to the virtual 
machine by returning to this directory and running vagrant ssh.

1) [Download and install Vagrant][vagrant] 1.2.3 or greater.

2) Install the vagrant "box" and get it running

```
vagrant init coreos http://storage.core-os.net/coreos/amd64-generic/dev-channel/coreos_production_vagrant.box
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```
